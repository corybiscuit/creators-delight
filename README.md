# Creator's Delight

**Creator's Delight** is a 1.19.2 modpack built with a vanilla+ aesthetic in mind. Trying to stick close to the vanilla feel, this modpack fleshes out existing vanilla mechanics and introduces a few new ones as well.

Work on automating your industrial farming complex with [Create](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create)! Or maybe just sticking to a barebones hand-worked field is more your speed and you just want some more crops from [Farmer's Delight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight)! Did you say creative building is more your style? Build to your heart's content with new cosmetic blocks from [Re-chiseled](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rechiseled), [Decorative Blocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/decorative-blocks), and [Supplementaries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/supplementaries).

A full modlist can be found [here](https://github.com/corybiscuit/creators-delight/blob/main/modlist.txt).

For the best playing experience possible, we recommend allocating 4GB of RAM to your game.
